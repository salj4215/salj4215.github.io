                <p>Hey! Thanks for visiting my portfolio! My name is Sal and I am a software developer working in the
                    state of Michigan. I have a passion for tech and what better way to engage in it than by writing
                the code that makes it useful for everyone. Welcome! </p>

            <h2 class="major">About</h2>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <p>I am a software developer working out of the metro Detroit area.
                I graduated with a college degree focusing on computer programming.
                I have a year of professional experience through working with my current employer, Sea Sight Systems
                and Services based out of Trenton, MI. I have worked on projects utilizing C# for desktop applications and Xamarin for mobile applications.
                By the way, check out my <a href="#work">awesome work</a>.</p>
            <p>I also wrote software using C, C++, Java, HTML5, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and .net. I have utilized databases using MSSQL, MySql, and MariaDB. I am
            also familiar with Unix and Linux and used bash during my time in college. For version control, we used Git at college and at the company I work for.</p>
            <p>Before I started working as a software developer, I worked for a specialty pharmacy for 8 years. What this means is that I have a broad set of skills that goes
            beyond programming. </p>

            <h2 class="major">Work</h2>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/CompoundingUtilities.gif" alt="" /></span>
            <p>I built an application that compounding pharmacies would use to calculate the amount of a medicinal ingredient to add to a compound to achieve the potency prescribed by a physician.
            The medicine comes in powder form from the manufacturer and the purity and Loss On Drying are printed on the label. The pharmacist would calculate by hand how much of the ingredient to add
            to the compound and account for its purity. This application would do the math for the pharmacist and save time, making the process more efficient. I built the software using C# in Visual Studio.</p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="images/GV.gif" alt="" /></span>
            <p>GV is an application I built so users are able to watch live streams from Twitch on their desktop or laptop, instead of using the website twitch.tv. I built it when Twitch did
            not have their own desktop application yet. The application allowed users to enter a streamer's name and a preview would pop up. The user then had the option to open the live stream
            in their default player or in VLC. The user can also open the chat from GV and chat with the other viewers. The app made watching multiple streams at the same time possible, as well
            as making it possible to record the stream and save the clip to their PC.  I built this app using VB.Net in Visual Studio.</p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="images/RoverClientShort.gif" alt="" /></span>
            <p>RoverClient is a mobile application I built for Sea Sight Systems, my most recent employer. The app connects to a GPS rover via bluetooth and captures gps coordinates and height
            data coming from the rover. The app also transforms the latitude, longitude, and height coordinates into X, Y, and Z coordinates that can be projected onto a 2D surface. The app
            also allows users to use the Tilt-Compensation function of the rover when its on a pole. This function allows the user to take coordinates without having to keep the pole totally
            vertical. The app was built using Xamarin in Visual Studio.</p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <h3>U.S. First</h3>
            <p>During my final three years of high school at Fordson High, I was part of the school's US First robotics team. We were team 184. The aim of U.S. First is to
                "inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering,
                and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership." (Dean Kamen, Founder
                of US First) The teams are paired up with 2 or 3 engineers that volunteer their time to help the students build and design the robots. Each year a game is designed with
                objectives that the robots must be designed to complete. My first year, we had 3 engineers that dedicated their time to help us design our robots. My second year, the engineers
                were not able to participate so we had engineers from other teams come in every so often to help. Us students had the challenge of building the robots ourselves with minimal help.
                That year, we were awarded the "Failure is Not an Option" award for dealing with mechanical issues without any professional engineers on hand. As for my final year, we only had
                the help of one engineer that was already assigned to another team. He would come in for one or two days to help program the robot . As for everything else, it was up to me and
                my team to build the robot. My friend and I took the role of the captains and lead our team. We were the only team on U.S. First to build a functional robot without any professional
                engineers and qualify for the season.

            <h3>Biomed Specialty Pharmacy</h3>
            <p>I worked for Biomed Specialty Pharmacy for 8 years. I was the senior technician and I.T. Lead at the headquarters. I was responsible for filling medication, producing compounded medications,
            and being the lead on I.T. projects. Some of the projects I lead were the upgrading of PC hardware, replacing failing hard drives on the server, and getting a 20 computer call center
            up and running from scratch. The pharmacy gave me the insight I needed to create the compounding tool that is shown on the Work page. My time at the pharmacy also taught me how to
            manage others when I became the manager of the Pharmor compounding pharmacy created in the same building of the headquarters.</p>

            <h3>Sea Sight Systems and Services</h3>
            <p>Currently I work for a small company called Sea Sight Systems and Services as a software developer. The company designs hardware and software solutions for dredging operations.
            I worked on their main product "ClamVision" which dredgers use to keep track of the material they moved from the bottom of lakes, rivers, and oceans. I also worked and
            improved on their CalcHMI tool that tracks the depth of the bucket when lowered into the water. My first major project while working their was creating a mobile application called
            RoverClient which is shown on my Work page.</p>
